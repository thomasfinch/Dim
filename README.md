Dim is a jailbreak tweak that lets you dim your iPhone or iPad screen below the minimum brightness by adding a black screen overlay with variable opacity. When enabled (through a Flipswitch toggle, Activator action, or the tweak's settings), the overlay opacity can be changed by using Activator actions or the tweak's settings.
